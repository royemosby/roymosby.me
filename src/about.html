<h1>About me</h1>

<p class="about-paragraph">I am a self-identified elder millennial. Married. 1 kid. Cats. Military retiree. I'm a fan of flat caps, cast iron cooking, and web technologies. Oh, and my sourdough starter's name is "Specimen Gamma".</p>

<p class="about-paragraph">I am a software engineer specializing in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and all the fun tie-ins in between. I am open to career opportunities.</p>

<p class="about-paragraph">I also have <a href="https://nostories.recipes/index.html">a small recipe site</a> that I promise does not contain any annoying stories!</p>
